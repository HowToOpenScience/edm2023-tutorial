Across the past decade, open science has increased in momentum, making research more openly available and reproducible.  Educational data mining, as a subfield of education technology, has been expanding in scope as well, developing and providing better understanding of large amount of data within education. However, open science and educational data mining do not often intersect, causing a bit of difficulty when trying to reuse methodologies, datasets, analyses for replication, reproduction, or an entirely separate end goal. In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of open science practices and their benefits and mitigation within research. In the second part of this tutorial, we will use the [Open Science Framework][osf] to make, collaborate, and share projects â€“ demonstrating how to make materials, code, and data open. The final part of this tutorial will go over some mitigation strategies when releasing datasets and materials so other researchers may easily reproduce them. Participants in this tutorial learn what the practices of open science are, how to use them in their own research, and how to use the Open Science Framework.
